# 004 — Integrate Feedback and Iterate
### Let the feedback of the people you’re designing for guide the next iteration of your solution.

Integrating the feedback you hear from the people you’re designing for is one of the essential elements of human-centered design. You learned from people in the Inspiration Phase, and in the Ideation Phase one of the best ways to keep learning from them is to show them what you’ve made and find out what they think. Integrating their feedback into your work and then coming up with another prototype is the best way to refine your idea until it’s something that’s bound to be adopted and embraced.

### Steps
01. Sit with your design team and share the feedback that you collected. Use the [Share Inspiring Stories](design-method-013.md) or [Download Your Learnings](design-method-012.md) methods to share what you learned.
02. You’ll now probably want to synthesize some of the feedback you got. You can [Create Frameworks](design-method-014.md) based on what you heard and how it applies to your idea. You might also now try a [Brainstorm](design-method-001.md) around how your idea could change based on your feedback.
03. Get tangible now and start building the next iteration of your prototype. Integrating Feedback and Iterating is closely tied to [Rapid Prototyping](design-method-026.md). So once you’ve determined how your prototype should change to reflect the feedback you got, build it.
04. Remember that this is a method for refining your idea, not for getting to the ultimate solution the first time. You’ll probably do it a few times to work out the kinks and get to the right answer.
